# Join and Subquery

## This category deals primarily with a foundational concept in relational database systems: joining. Joining allows you to combine related information from multiple tables to answer a question. This isn't just beneficial for ease of querying: a lack of join capability encourages denormalisation of data, which increases the complexity of keeping your data internally consistent.

## This topic covers inner, outer, and self joins, as well as spending a little time on subqueries (queries within queries).
