## A. Customer Journey

### Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.


First, let's learn how to select 8 random customers from the `subscriptions` table. 

```SQL
SELECT customer_id
FROM subscriptions
ORDER BY RANDOM()
LIMIT 8
```

Result:

<pre>
 customer_id 
-------------
         777
          87
          31
         498
         441
         182
         871
         416
</pre>

Using above lines of code, we can select 8 random customers from the `subscriptions` table. The problem is that `RANDOM()` function will always choose random values between 0 and 1. For our purpose here we don't require that. We need same set of customers every time we run the code so we will use `SETSEED()` function to set the seed before calling the `RANDOM()` function which will return same set of customer all the time. 

Let's implement the above idea.


```SQL
SELECT setseed(0.652);

SELECT s.customer_id, 
       s.plan_id, 
       p.plan_name, 
       s.start_date
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p
    ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE s.customer_id IN (
                          SELECT customer_id
                          FROM subscriptions
                          ORDER BY RANDOM()
                          LIMIT 8
                      )
ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.plan_id
```

Result:

<pre>
 customer_id | plan_id |   plan_name   | start_date 
-------------+---------+---------------+------------
           2 |       0 | trial         | 2020-09-20

         691 |       0 | trial         | 2020-06-15
         691 |       2 | pro monthly   | 2020-06-22
         691 |       3 | pro annual    | 2020-11-22
         830 |       0 | trial         | 2020-07-19
         830 |       1 | basic monthly | 2020-07-26
         830 |       2 | pro monthly   | 2020-12-26
         909 |       0 | trial         | 2020-09-09
