# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge

Welcome to my repository featuring solutions for the case studies in [8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/). The 8 Week SQL Challenge, initiated by [Danny Ma](https://www.datawithdanny.com/) through the Data With Danny virtual data apprenticeship program, comprises 8 distinct SQL challenges.

In each case-study folder, you'll find the following files:

* A readme file explaining the problem statement and datasets used
* SQL files for creating the schema, tables, and loading data
* Markdown files containing SQL queries that answer the respective challenge questions

### Note: Solutions are implemented in PostgreSQL
