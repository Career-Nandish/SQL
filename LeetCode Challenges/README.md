## Introduction
In this repository, you'll find a collection of SQL solutions to [LeetCode challenges](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/). Each challenge presents a unique problem, testing my understanding of SQL concepts, optimization techniques, and problem-solving skills.

## Challenges
Explore the challenges I've encountered and solved in this repository.

## Structure
The repository follows a clear structure to make navigation seamless:
- **`leetcode_challenges.md`**: The file contains the challenges I have encountered in order. I decided to go with a markdown format because it allows better user display. It contains problem title(linked to the actual leetcode challenge), problem statement and other vital information on tables involved in the challenge. It is followed by the solution of the problem.

## Usage
Feel free to explore, learn, and use these solutions for reference. If you have a different approach or an optimization, I encourage you to contribute and enhance the collective knowledge.

## Contributing
Contributions are highly valued! If you have a new solution, an optimization, or additional insights, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/new-solution`.
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Added a new solution for ChallengeName'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/new-solution`.
5. Open a pull request.
