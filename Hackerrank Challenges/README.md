## In [hackerrank_challenges.sql](hackerrank_challenges.sql), You can find all the challenges I have solved on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). The file contains most of the challenges I have attempted(in order) with their description and the link to the problem itself for ease of use. Some of the easy challenges might not be here since they didn't make the difficulty level I was hoping for. You can still find them on my [HackerRank Profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/career_nandish). If you have any suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me. Thanks and Happy Coding!!!
