## [20. [Medium] Second Highest Salary](https://datalemur.com/questions/sql-second-highest-salary)

Imagine you're an HR analyst at a tech company tasked with analyzing employee salaries. Your manager is keen on understanding the pay distribution and asks you to determine the second highest salary among all employees.

It's possible that multiple employees may share the same second highest salary. In case of duplicate, display the salary only once.

Table: `employee`

| column_name   | type    | description                        |
|---------------|---------|------------------------------------|
| employee_id   | integer | The unique ID of the employee.     |
| name          | string  | The name of the employee.          |
| salary        | integer | The salary of the employee.        |
| department_id | integer | The department ID of the employee. |
| manager_id    | integer | The manager ID of the employee.    |

```SQL
SELECT salary
FROM (
  SELECT employee_id,
         salary,
         RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
  FROM employee
) AS ranking_salary
WHERE rnk = 2
```

Result:

<pre>
| salary |

## [21. [Medium] Sending vs. Opening Snaps](https://datalemur.com/questions/time-spent-snaps)

Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages and time spent sending and opening snaps.

Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.

Calculate the following percentages:
    * Time spent sending / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
    * Time spent opening / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)

Table: `activities`

| Column Name   | Type                            |

| age_bucket  | string ('21-25', '26-30', '31-25') |

```SQL
SELECT age_bucket,
       ROUND(send_time * 100.0/(send_time + open_time), 2) AS send_perc,
       ROUND(open_time * 100.0/(send_time + open_time), 2) AS open_perc
FROM (
  SELECT ag.age_bucket,
         SUM(ac.time_spent) FILTER (WHERE ac.activity_type = 'open') AS open_time,
         SUM(ac.time_spent) FILTER (WHERE ac.activity_type = 'send') AS send_time
  FROM activities ac
  JOIN age_breakdown ag
      ON ac.user_id = ag.user_id
  GROUP BY ag.age_bucket

## [22. [Medium] Tweets' Rolling Averages](https://datalemur.com/questions/rolling-average-tweets)

Given a table of tweet data over a specified time period, calculate the 3-day rolling average of tweets for each user. Output the user ID, tweet date, and rolling averages rounded to 2 decimal places.

Notes:

* A rolling average, also known as a moving average or running mean is a time-series technique that examines trends in data over a specified period of time.
* In this case, we want to determine how the tweet count for each user changes over a 3-day period.

Table: `tweets`

| Column Name | Type      |
|-------------|-----------|
| user_id     | integer   |
| tweet_date  | timestamp |
| tweet_count | integer   |

```SQL
SELECT user_id,
       tweet_date,
       ROUND(AVG(tweet_count) OVER win, 2) AS rolling_avg_3d
FROM tweets
WINDOW win AS (
                  PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY tweet_date 
                  ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
